This project explores various sorting algorithms in C and analyzes their time complexity using Big O notation.

Goals:

Understand the concept of Big O notation and its significance in algorithm analysis.
Implement different sorting algorithms in C (e.g., Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort).
Analyze the time complexity of each implemented algorithm using Big O notation.
Compare the performance of different sorting algorithms based on their time complexity.
